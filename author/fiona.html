                                But it is Charlie's best friend, farming magnate <strong>Will Darcy</strong>, who leaves a lasting impression when he slights Lizzy, setting

                                <p>Can Lizzy and Will put judgements and pride aside to each see the other for who they really are? Or in an age where appearance
